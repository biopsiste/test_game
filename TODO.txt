[BUGFIX]
- 

[EXPLORE]
- text labels
- keyboard events
- subwindow
- gamepad support (much later in development)
- animation and framerate
-

[DESIGN]
- units motion
- projectile motion
- levels architecture
- Tile structure, needs traversability info (this includes traversal cost, it's not a boolean), height info!, texture info, etc...
- possibly a BattleTerrain object, needs tile matrix, etc...
- map panning, maybe top-down perspective, and possibly (no idea how to do this) rotating the map 90 deg by 90 deg
- pathing needs to be connected to a Terrain object, needs to know obstacles and tile traversal costs
-

[SYSTEMS]
- battle system!
- save/load system!
- character system!
- inventory system!
- levelling system!
-

[UTILS]
- organize the tilesets into an easy-to-access suitable container(s)
- pick a format (possibily standard) to export/import the tile structure of a level
- create a smart MultilineTextBox object
-
